# MyWorkEnv

Personal working environment setup for developers like myself. So I don't need to waste a lot of time to set it up all over again next time.
Tested on Ubuntu, Fedora, and MacOS. Welcome fork and customize to your personal favor.

## The setup including
Install and configure vim/gvim with necessary plugins to make it like a powerful IDE.
Install and configure tmux and bash with powerline fancy prompt.
